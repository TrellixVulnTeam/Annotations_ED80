### ERRORS IN ANNOTATION FILES ###

Missing a 'retracted' tag around 38.574
    -> sharif_demo_near_right_20191111-152526.json



the following annotation files have start/rest overlap errors.
this is caused during annotating, since the annotator cannont hear the start beeps,
the arm may appear to be at rest, when in fact a beep had just been played.
this issue can cause a rest to be recorded immediately following a start.
this creates 3 errors through the checker.py in the order of -start, -rest, -reached

a new method needs to be implemented to detect this specific error and perhaps fix it.
